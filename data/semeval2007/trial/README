TASK 17: English Lexical Sample, English SRL and English All-Words
------------------------------------------------------------------



The trial data packages contains two files:


LEXICAL SAMPLE FILE: 
-------------------

filename: English.lex-sample.txt
--------

The format of this file is quite similar to the earlier semeval
lexical-sample formats.  The one main change in this version is that
the answer element now has attributes "on", "wn" and "wn-version"
which respectively represent the ontonotes sense id, the group of
wordnet senses that it corresponds to, and the version of wordnet that
was used to perform the manual grouping.  following shows an example
from the traial data file.

<lexelt item=construct.v> 

<instance id="15:0@0@wsj/11/wsj_1126@wsj" corpus="wsj">
<answer lemma="construct" pos="v" on="1" wn="1,2,4,5" wn-version="2.1"/>

SEMANTIC ROLES FILE:
-------------------

files: srl/*
-----

These files have a format very similar to the CoNLL 2005 shared task files. t
The only difference is that there are no Clause-based, Chunk-based, features
or Collins' parse.  It contains a split version of Charniak parse and the POS
extracted from the same.  In addition, this format has a id for each example
represented by the wsj document number, sentence number and predicate index.
The columns represent respectively the following:

column 1: id
column 2: word
column 3: verbnet class
column 4: propbank sense
column 5: part of speech (extracted from Charniak parse)
column 6: Charniak parse tokens
column 7: Propbank Propositions
column 8: Mapped Thematic Roles
